## Findings 

It is inherently difficult to differentiate between the occurence of the two diseases from a normal x-ray. In fact, ~20 million radiology reports contain clinically significant errors, where 10% play a role in patient deaths. Deep learning offers a solution to this problem.

Saliency maps can help us better understand the features in the x-rays and visualize what areas of the image are of high importance. The areas of yellow gradient have the greatest influence on the model's prediction.
